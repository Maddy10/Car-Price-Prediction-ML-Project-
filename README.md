# Car Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of a car based on various features such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, and other attributes. The model is built using Linear Regression and is deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use a dataset containing information about different cars and their prices. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car based on its features. We will first train the model using Linear Regression and then deploy the model as a simple web application for users to input the features and receive the predicted price of a car.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the Linear Regression model.
- **Streamlit**: For deploying the machine learning model as a web application.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization (optional).
- **Jupyter Notebook/VS Code**: For code development.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars, including features such as:
- Car brand
- Model
- Year of manufacture
- kms driven
- Fuel type
- Price

You can download the dataset from above or use a similar dataset from your own.
